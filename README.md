# smart-retail-weather
This project collects weather data for Mumbai using a public API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It provides visualizations of weather trends over the past 30 days and uses a basic machine learning model to forecast temperatures for the next 7 days. The insights from this project could help retailers adjust their inventory based on weather conditions. All code and related files are included here for easy setup and use.
